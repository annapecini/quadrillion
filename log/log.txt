- New Ideas - 
  - "Campaign mode": levels are scattered throughout treasure hunt map, in style of Candy Crush.
    - Possible implementations:
      - Treasure hidden somewhere in the map, completing levels provides cryptic hints.
        - E.g. "The treasure is in the detail."
      - Some levels have missing pieces to prevent the player from directly jumping into harder puzzles. The player must complete
        certain levels to gather all the pieces for a "blocking puzzle" to progress through the game. In style of the game, Braid.
      - A round of Quadrillion in the map interface: The player collects a piece upon completing some level. The point of the game 
        is now to complete all the necessary levels to gather the pieces for the puzzle in the map. Upon finishing the final puzzle
        in the map interface, the player receives some award. Note: the puzzle itself is a very difficult game of Quadrillion. In
        style of the game, The Talos Principle.
        - E.g. The player creceives a big "hurrah".
- "User profiles": Each user has a profile, which contains the following:
  - "Must have" features:
    - Settings configuration for that particular user.
    - User name.
    - User progression (levels completed, perhaps even statistics like elapsed time etc.).
    - List of collectibles (themes for grids, background music, etc.).
  - "Maybe" features that depend upon the quality of the implementation:
    - Password authentication, in the case that it is deemed necessary.
    - Score keeping for a high score table, in the case that highscores are actually implemented.
    - List of unlocked achievements, in the case that achievements are actually implemented.
    - Multiplayer history, in the case that multiplayer mode is actually implemented.
- Ongoing Issues & Possible Desiderata -
  - Note: Most of these are actually solved, but it is better to clarify/finalize the decisions.
  - Library for GUI/Graphics
    - AWT vs. Swing vs. JavaFX vs. OpenGL vs. some other library?
  - Database utilization
    - Password authentication (store hashes!)
    - Keep all time highscores vs. keep scores locally
  - Work allocation: Who does what?
