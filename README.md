  </h1>
  
  <p class="lead">
      We aim to include new features such as:
   <ul>
        <li>
          Time constraints for different levels
        </li>
        <li>
          Multiple themes (background and colors to choose from)
        </li>
        <li>
          Easy, medium and hard versions (based on different grid sizes and time constraints)
        </li>
        <li>
          Hints (ex. ability to look at the solved board for 5 seconds, which can be enabled after a certain time has passed. A hint can be awarded after completing a fixed number of levels and hints can be collected)
        </li>
        <li>
          Highscore tables
        </li> 
        <li>
          Achievements
        </li>
        <li>
          Ladder mode daily challenge: Start from easy puzzles and time constraints. The game gets progressively harder both in puzzle difficulty and stiffness of the time constraint as more puzzles are solved. This mode can only be attempted daily, and has a separate highscore table. Scores are a weighted sum of the number of puzzles solved; weights are determined via difficulty and progression.
        </li>
        <li>
          1v1 Multiplayer: Two people, one puzzle. One who solves first, wins.
        </li> 
    </ul>
