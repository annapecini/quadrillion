      This application is desktop version of the 'Quadrillion' board game. The original game is an IQ puzzle which consists of 4 4x4 grids which can be rotated, flipped and combined together in multiple ways, and 12 puzzle pieces of different sizes and shapes. Each square grid has fixed positions on top of which no puzzle piece can be placed. The aim of the game is to arrange the puzzle pieces in such a way that they fit perfectly on the grid without leaving any empty spaces. Each one of the 638 976 starting configurations of the grids guarantees at least one solution, but some arrangements can have as many as 100'000 possible placements.
